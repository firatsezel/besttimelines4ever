This includes the sun, planets and our solar system. At the center, the sun swept in smaller elements like hydrogen and helium. Farther away, heavier elements formed planets. Based on the core accretion model, gravity was the driver coalescing Earth from a cloud of dust.","date":"~4.6 BILLION YEARS AGO","icon":"GiWorld"},{"header":"Boom! Earth-Moon collision","title":"","description":"The final collision in Earth\'s timeline was with Theia, a rocky planetoid perhaps the size of Mars. This protoplanet sideswiped Earth, leaving our planet mostly intact but destroying itself and blowing away Earth\'s atmosphere. Theia\'s vaporized debris condensed into Earth\'s moon. Some researchers think remnants of the pre-collision Earth still exist deep in Earth\'s mantle and outer core today.","date":"","icon":"GiMoon"},{"header":"Late Bombardment Stage","title":"","description":"In the late Hadean Eon, the Earth was still in its late heavy bombardment stage. Earth was hit by asteroids, comets and foreign objects left, right and center. We know it wasn\u2019t only Earth because we can see these impacts other places in our solar system.","date":"","icon":"GiHeavyRain"},{"header":"First Oceans","title":"","description":"The collision of the moon into Earth significantly impacted climate, oceans and life on Earth. Because the moon\u2019s orbit drags Earth, it slowed Earth\u2019s rotation significantly from 6 hour days to 24 hours.","date":"~4.0 BILLION YEARS AGO","icon":"GiAtSea"},{"header":"First DNA","title":"","description":"Some scientists believe that water originated from the bombardment of comets at this time. In addition, there\u2019s reason to believe that these collisions could have sparked the chemical building blocks for life \'DNA\'.","date":"","icon":"GiDna2"},{"header":"First Continent","title":"","description":"Eventually, the climate on Earth became more stable in the Archean Eon. Instead of a molten state, the Earth started to cool down. Water vapor condensed to form oceans. And the Earth cooled down enough to create continents. Though opinions vary, \u201cVaalbara\u201d became Earth\u2019s first supercontinent.","date":"","icon":"GiAntarctica"},{"header":"First Bacteria","title":"","description":"As the Earth cooled down, a new form of life began to prosper. When oxygen was absent in the atmosphere, cyanobacteria could convert sunlight to energy. In shallow water, they metabolized their own food.","date":"","icon":"GiParmecia"},{"header":"Great Oxygenation Event","title":"","description":"Cyanobacteria released oxygen into the oceans. When oxygen mixed with iron in the oceans, rusted iron collected on the seafloor. Oxygen had nowhere to go but into the atmosphere. That\u2019s why this event is the Great Oxygenation Event.","date":"~2.5 BILLION YEARS AGO","icon":"GiLungs"},{"header":"Oxygen Crisis","title":"","description":"Earth now had an oxygenated atmosphere for new life to flourish on Earth. But it wasn\u2019t cyanobacteria flourishing. Because oxygen was toxic for cyanobacteria, they poisoned all anaerobic life on Earth including themselves. Imagine a dominant species polluting the planet until extinction. The oxygen byproduct from cyanobacteria created an oxygen crisis on Earth.","date":"","icon":"GiDrowning"},{"header":"Snowball Earth","title":"","description":"At this time, methane was more abundant in the atmosphere. One thing that methane did very well was trap heat in the atmosphere. It\u2019s one of the most efficient greenhouse gases there are. So when oxygen combined with methane, it produced carbon dioxide. All of a sudden, the greenhouse effect wasn\u2019t as strong. As a result, the whole planet froze. It was \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d as the Earth went into an ice age for the next 300,000,000 years.","date":"","icon":"GiSnowflake2"},{"header":"Multicellular Life","title":"","description":"Before oxygenation, life was anaerobic. Eventually, aerobic respiration organisms emerged because of the enriched atmosphere. This increased the complexity of life. For example, multi-cellular organisms became apparent in this eon. But the abundance of CO2 held eukaryotes from diversifying.","date":"","icon":"GiHoneycomb"},{"header":"Ozone Stabilization","title":"","description":"As oxygen filled the atmosphere, Earth\u2019s ozone layer thickened. Before the presence of an ozone layer, life was restricted to shallow water. Because water shielded harmful radiation, that\u2019s where life existed. Eventually, a thicker ozone layer (O3) enabled life to diversify on land in the Proterozoic Eon.","date":"","icon":"GiNightSky"},{"header":"The Age of Invertebrates","title":"","description":"Hard-shelled invertebrates originated in the oceans. The Cambrian explosion started with the Age of Invertebrates. And life got more diverse from there.","date":"","icon":"GiNautilusShell"},{"header":"The Age of Fish","title":"","description":"Next came the Age of Fish when thousands of fish species arose. Then, the first vertebrate land animal made its leap ashore.","date":"","icon":"GiTropicalFish"},{"header":"The Age of Amphibians","title":"","description":"Amphibians took a breath of fresh air and colonized the empty continent of Gondwana. This was the start of the Age of Amphibians. We share similar characteristics as our vertebrate ancestors. For example, humans have spines, jaws and mouths originating from fish.","date":"","icon":"GiFrog"},{"header":"The Extinction","title":"","description":"The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest extinction in Earth\u2019s history. The Permian-Triassic Extinction vanquished 96% of all marine species. About 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species were wiped out. Opinions vary about the Permian-Triassic Extinction cause. But the consensus is that it was from a major asteroid impact event.","date":"~245 MILLION YEARS AGO","icon":"GiFire"},{"header":"The Age of Reptiles","title":"","description":"When Earth\u2019s climate became hotter and drier, rainforests collapsed triggering the Age of Reptiles. Reptiles are different from amphibians because they lay their hard-shelled eggs on land. They essentially adapted to the land by cutting all ties with the ocean. Because reptiles evolved to dryland conditions, they gained a unique ecological advantage.","date":"","icon":"GiReptileTail"},{"header":"The Age of Dinosaurs","title":"","description":"As conditions changed, dinosaurs (also known as terrible lizards) began to evolve. These reptile-like mammals had scaly skin and hatched eggs like reptiles. Some dinosaurs adapted as herbivores and some as carnivores. For the next 160 million years, dinosaurs were the dominant land vertebrates on Earth.","date":"","icon":"GiVelociraptor"},{"header":"Small Mammals","title":"","description":"The Age of Conifers in the Mesozoic Era provided the spread of seeded plants. Conifers store vast amounts of carbon. As a result, oxygen content in the atmosphere jumped to 35% compared to 21% today. In addition, they provided habitat, shelter and a source of food for specific animal species to survive.","date":"~66 MILLION YEARS AGO","icon":"GiMonkey"},{"header":"Extinction of Dinosaurs","title":"","description":"Ultimately, the start of the Cenozoic Era was the demise of dinosaurs. After a 6-mile wide asteroid hit Earth, a dust cloud blocked the sun. This caused temperatures to plummet which was the heart of the damage from the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. Because of the worldwide climate disruption, it was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs.","date":"","icon":"GiDinosaurBones"},{"header":"The Age of Mammals","title":"","description":"Mammals existed long before the Cenozoic Era. But they kept a low profile because dinosaurs dominated the land. After the extinction of the dinosaurs, this marked the Age of Mammals. When dinosaurs roamed the Earth, mammals remained small and furry. And because dinosaurs went extinct, mammals emerged as the largest land animals at this time.","date":"","icon":"GiGorilla"},{"header":"Primates","title":"","description":"Apes remained in trees for their primary food source. Eventually, grass began to spread in places like the African Savannah and there were fewer trees. This forced apes to walk to new food sources. With their heads above the grass to see predators, apes evolved by walking on two legs. It also helped to have their hands available when they were traveling.","date":"","icon":"GiDeathSkull"}]}')},273:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var
